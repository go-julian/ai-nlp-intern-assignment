# NLP AI intern assignment
## Exercise 1 - Named Entity Recognition
This is the instruction for AI intern assignment at [Golden Owl](https://goldenowl.asia). You will build a simple NER model base on [Spacy](https://spacy.io/usage).

Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Python with Spacy. NER can be used for content classification, the various Named Entities of a text can be collected, and based on that data, the content themes can be understood. In academics and research, NER can be used to retrieve data and information faster from a wide variety of textual information. NER helps a lot in the case of information extraction from huge text datasets. Spacy is an open-source Natural Language Processing library that can be used for various tasks. It has built-in methods for Named Entity Recognition. Spacy has a fast statistical entity recognition system.

You will do “**Resume Shortlisting**”. For example:

In this exercise, you need to write a program in Python to predict the name and email in the Resúme. For dataset that includes 200 Resúmes([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rM5TKOXiUpWodflVEhtm8aAgnhvVzLrf/view?usp=drive_link))

### Requirements
- Your program gets the input as pdf file and print the output(name, email)
- Describe briefly your solution in a report (i.e: your pipeline, algorithms that we use, remaining problem as well as ideas for improvements,...).
- Your solution will be evaluated on our private dataset. So, you need to submit your source and the report.
- Do not forget to write a README.md (i.e: environment requirements, how to run) to guide us to reproduce your code easily.
## Exercise 2 – Text to speech
Text to speech (TTS) is a technology that converts text into spoken audio. It can read aloud PDFs, websites, and books using natural AI voices.. Text-to-speech (TTS) technology can be helpful for anyone who needs to access written content in an auditory format, and it can provide a more inclusive and accessible way of communication for many people.

In this exercise, you are requested to propose your ideas for how to build TTS model (Vietnamese)
### Requirements
-	Proposes your ideas and describes them in a report (i.e: your pipeline, algorithms,...).
-	Try to analyze the problem that we can face and how to solve them.
